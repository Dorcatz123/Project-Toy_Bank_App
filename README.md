**Description:

This is a mini project using python programming language to build a miniature ATM simulator. This program lets you interact with a virtual ATM machine. You can do all all kinds of processes like withdrawing and depositing money, creating new bank account etc.

**Objective:

The objective of this program is to put into use various basic concepts such as OOP's, data types to build a simple toy bank/ATM app. 

**Customization:

You can customize this project in any way possible. You can add more functionalities to this bank app for example you can add your beneficiaries and try adding this new information in the self.x object in the classbank.py file so that when the user tries to access the transactions they can view their beneficiaries (note that this is a bit challenging! you need to know the entire code to do this!).



**Challenges: 

Modifying this to include other functionalities can be challenging! since you need to understand the structure and function of the codes in the two associated files.


**Python: 

This program is entirely built on python. This project is a perfect example of showcasing basic python coding skills to built an amazing tool such as an ATM machine for fun or for educational purpose!
